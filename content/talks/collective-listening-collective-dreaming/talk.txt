Description: Through listening moments, readings and sharing stories from projects developed over the last decade, we will think about how histories of radical pedagogy and practices of listening play a role in community practice and collective imagining. What are the ways that collective imagining can create alternative spaces for contesting power and advocating for new forms of relation? As an artist, organiser or designer how do you ground your practice in supporting collective desire? The challenge of including the arts and pedagogical practices meaningfully in research, organising and community initiatives is not new, but has grown more important in these crisis-ridden times. There is a need for more collaborative work embracing interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary research and action.
