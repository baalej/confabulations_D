Description: Dr. Bess Williamson will share some key moments in historical and current practices of design that addresses disability. From origins in the post-World War II decades, to recent creative efforts, disabled people and their allies have identified the potential for design to align with ideas of social change and justiceâ€”but that this means confronting biases and resistance on local and global levels.
