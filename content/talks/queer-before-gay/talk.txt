Description:

In post-communist states, where a number of historical threads were broken or, in fact, never emerged, there has been an attempt to construct national identities anew and to create fresh narratives. Today, recent history, including art history, is being largely (re)constructed, as well as often tampered with. In my artistic practice I am particularly interested in such procedures, namely appendicising, rewriting and revising art history from the queer perspective. In my presentation I will take special interest in the ways in which archive-based art can have a political impact on our present and future, including its numerous aspects (i.e. cultural, social and sexual). My long term project titled *Queer Archives Institute* (QAI) will be offered as an example of this methodology.

Founded in 2015 the *Queer Archives Institute* is a non-profit informal artist-run organisation dedicated to research, collection, digitalisation, presentation, exhibition, analysis and artistic interpretation of queer archives, with special focus on Central and Eastern Europe. In my presentation I will present the different forms the QAI takes - from an exhibition to a temporary office, a publication, a performance, a lecture. I will reflect also on queer self-publishing practice taking as an example Polish *Filo* zine from the 1980s and my own *DIK Fagazine* mag.
