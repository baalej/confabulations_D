Description: In her own words, the American photographer Tee Corinne spent the 1970s ‘exploring ways to make images that read as lesbian’. Making images—as opposed to the more conventional phrasing of taking them— implied that there was both practical and creative work to be done. With her long-term friend and collaborator, and some-time lover, Honey Lee Cottrell, Corinne critically examined the troubled history of photographic representation and experimented with photographic techniques to confront an absence of lesbian representation. A burgeoning feminist press was integral to the work of Corinne and her contemporaries. In this talk, based on a book I am currently writing, I will examine the intertwined ideas of making and reading lesbian images made in the 1970s and '80s in order to think about how histories of queer photography are entangled with histories of queer design.
