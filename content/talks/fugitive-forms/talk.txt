Description: Taking the lead from Fred Moten and Harney’s criticism of academia and call for dissident forms of knowledge production, this presentation will explore the lives and the work of a group of 20th century figures that enacted forms of fugitivity *avant-la-lettre*. We will adopt a notion of fugitivity intended both as a breaching of the institutional frame, as well as a desire to trespass the boundaries between theory and practice, different media, literary genres and ultimately art and politics. We will first examine how critic Carla Lonzi’s decision to leave the artworld and embrace separatist feminism, was paralleled by a transfiguration of her mode of writing, aimed at challenging the artifice of language. We will then move to the erratic literary production of 70s gay activist Mario Mieli, which we will examine in light of his political attempt to replace identity with a world of erotic abundance.
