Description: In this book talk drawn form *Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies* (Duke, 2020), I outline how lesbian feminists in the U.S. and Canada approached publishing as an information practice key to establishing a foundation for their movements, and building more livable lives for lesbians. Focusing on newsletters, bibliographies and indexes, I show how activists created and circulating information as a world-making process when access to information was otherwise precarious.

Bio: Cait McKinney is Assistant Professor of Communication at Simon Fraser University, the author of *Information Activism: A Queer History of Lesbian Media Technologies *(Duke, 2020), and coeditor of *Inside Killjoyâ€™s Kastle: Dykey Ghosts, Feminist Monsters, and other Lesbian Hauntings* (UBC, 2019). McKinney is interested in how queer social movements use digital technologies to build alternative information infrastructures. Their current research is on activist responses to early online content regulations; the intertwined histories of AIDS Activism and digital technologies; and the ways sexuality has been used to explain data and databases since the mid 20th century.
