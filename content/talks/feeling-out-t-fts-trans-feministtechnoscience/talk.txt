Description: Walking along a the uneven accountabilities of trans* feminist technoscience and critical pedagogy: *Feeling out T*FTS (Trans*FeministTechnoScience)* will be a lecture based in a not emerged (non-linear and between) timeline. Based in queer theory, trans* studies, feminist technoscience and disability justice the lecture will be a remixing of different theoretical texts and artistic and design projects that have impacted me as an artist and researcher. Feelings will be prioritised and omissions are promised.
