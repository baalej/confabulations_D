Description:

In 1925, Alain LeRoy Locke was asked to be guest editor of an issue of *Survey Graphic*, the richly designed periodical covering sociological and political issues of the day. The issue, titled *Harlem: Mecca of the New Negro*, was Locke’s first publication wherein he connected an emerging generation of young black writers, poets, and artists, to what would be known as the Harlem Renaissance. The infamous issue became the basis for the seminal 1925 anthology *The New Negro*, which marked a shift from a focus on Black bodies to Black consciousness and Black thought.

The following year, a collective of young, black, and some queer artists would write, design, and self-publish *FIRE!!*, a publication devoted to younger Negro artists. *FIRE!!* was conceived by Langston Hughes and Bruce Nugent, both of who had work featured in *The New Negro*. They enlisted Wallace Thurman to edit the publication, and commissioned other black artists to contribute to its pages. The magazine’s varied content contained diverse genres, including essay, design, illustration, plays, and poetry. Tragically, the headquarters of *FIRE!! *burned down after the completion of the first issue, but not before its content made equally fiery controversy.
