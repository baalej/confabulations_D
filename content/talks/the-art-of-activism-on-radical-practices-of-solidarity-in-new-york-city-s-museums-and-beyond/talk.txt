Description: Museums are places that are set up to out-survive us. They serve the public and are seen as important places in which a society can define itself and present itself. Museums solidify and legitimate culture…. this is why they have been such important stages of activism! The battle against the supposed neutrality of the Museum has been an ongoing artistic and political investigation. This talk will explore questions that art activism in New York City has raised about identity and the social politics of representation and appropriation in the museum. We’ll consider artistic practices of solidarity though a Black feminist lens, listening to images of protest in order to think through what a radical practice of coalition building might look like in art spaces.
