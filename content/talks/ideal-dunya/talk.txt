Bio: Harsh Patel (b. Nairobi) is a graphic designer based in Los Angeles. “I formed my independent practice in the 'post 9/11' arena, after earning my BFA in design from the University of Texas, Austin. As an immigrant from a working background, communicating my experiences and values has always been the core of a tenable professional life. I believe that design studies should more clearly reflect globalization's broadening critical spectrum. The continuous blurring of lines dividing visual communication, commercial design, and what's deemed art requires a more accessible academic dialogue that is fluent in issues of responsible representation.”
